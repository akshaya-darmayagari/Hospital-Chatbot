# Hospital Chatbot - Java Swing Application

## Project Overview

Hospital Chatbot is a Java Swing-based desktop application designed to manage hospital appointments through an interactive graphical user interface. Users can view doctors, book appointments with time slots, cancel appointments (except for specific hospitals), and filter/view booked appointments efficiently.

- View doctors available in each hospital
- Book appointments with:
  - Doctor selection
  - Date picker (only future dates allowed)
  - 20-minute time slots from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM (with a lunch break)
  - Patient name input
- Cancel appointments (disabled for Sunrise Hospital)
- View and filter booked appointments by doctor and date
- Appointment confirmation displayed in a formatted letter
- User-friendly GUI with styled buttons and color-coded windows

## Technologies Used

- Java SE (Standard Edition)
- Java Swing for GUI components
- Core Java Collections (HashMap, ArrayList, etc.)
- Java AWT for colors and fonts

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans).
3. Compile and run the `HospitalChatbotSwingc4.java` class.
